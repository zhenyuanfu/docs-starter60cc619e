# Quickstart

> You can seamlessly launch your docs sites following 4 steps below.

## Step1 Connect your contents

To start your project, you'll link your GitHub repository, and leverage the MDX, OpenAPI documents for website generation, while keeping the contents live alongside your codebase.

For more information, please check [Set up your first project](./Set%20up%20your%20first%20project.mdx) .

## Step4 Engage your users

Data analysis enables you to deeply understand the information on page views, search analysis, session records and more, bridging the gap between your knowledge base and end-users.

For more information, please check [Search](../Engaging%20users/Search.mdx) & [Analytics](../Engaging%20users/Analytics.mdx) .
