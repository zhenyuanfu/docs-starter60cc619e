# Markdown editor

You can directly edit your documents using the markdown editor on the platform.

<Note title="Note">
The Markdown Editor uses a short-hand syntax style text to create documents and then converts the text to HTML. It is handy when more text files are involved.
</Note>

Log in to Docuo platform, and click "Editor" to enter the markdown editor page. You will see your docs repository directory on the left side of the page.

You can edit your existing md/mdx or json files on the platform. Then click "**Publish**" button in the upper right corner of the page to update your edited content to the website.

## Doc front matter

The front matter is used to provide additional metadata for your doc page. Front matter is optionalâ€”Docuo will be able to infer all necessary metadata without the front matter.

Markdown documents can use the following Markdown front matter metadata fields, enclosed by a line --- on either side.

Accepted fields:
